# Roam-RTL
 
## How to install:

### CSS
1. Create a [[roam/css]] page in your Roam database (or go to that page if it already exist).
2. create a code block in the [[roam/css]] page and paste the css code from the `Roam-RTL.css` file in it and change the language selector on the top right of the code block to "CSS".

## How to use:

Use #RTL tag in the start of the block to apply the custom CSS to that block and all nested blocks (the tag disappears when you're not in the block).
